Module 11 Challenge - Notetaker

In this challenge, I used provided starter code to create a note taking app that allows a user to save a note with both a title and text and then have that note displayed.

The deployed application can be found at the following URL:  https://powerful-springs-65637.herokuapp.com/

Thanks to the tutors, TA's and instructor for help on this project, especially with file structure and working with Heroku.
